The role requires you to be a keen listener throughout the meeting.\n\nC - Crutch words (and, so, but)\nR - Repeats (I..I, this means, this means)\nP - Pauses (Unnecessary long pause)\nF - Filler sounds (ah, Um, er)\n\nGuidelines to be read when asked to introduce your role during the meeting:",

    "text": "Guidelines to be read when asked to introduce your role during the meeting:\n\nThank you, Mister/Madam Toastmaster, Fellow Toastmasters, and welcome Guests! My duty as the “Ah” Counter is to listen carefully for verbal distractions, such as “um,” “ah”, “you know,” “and-so,” “but,” and other filler words or sounds. I will also keep track of the repeated words, like “the, the,” and, “I, I.” Lastly, I keep track of long pauses. I will keep track of the number of these speaking errors in writing for each person that speaks and give a report when called upon at the end of the meeting. \n\nWhen the GE calls you to give out the Ah counter report:\n\nWhen you give your report in the end in the interest of time, just share total crutch words used by a person and mention their most used words. However if there is time then ideally read out the entire report. Do give a suggestion or two to avoid crutch words.",
