Hello everyone, my name is … and I am your table topic master. You must be wondering what table topics is? The table topics segment in a Toastmasters meeting is an impromptu speaking segment where I will be reading out a topic and calling out one of the members from the audience to speak on it spontaneously. The time limit is 1-2 mins so for you to qualify for voting you need to speak a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 2 mins. The segment helps you think on your feet and makes you more spontaneous. One pro tip to crack the table topics is to use an example whenever you get a topic that will help you not run out of your words. Hope to see to ace this. Are we all ready for our first topic?",

(Take consent of first-timers - Ideal to ask them over a message before the TTM session if they are comfortable speaking)\nIf no-one else is left, then pick on Toastmasters who played the least role in the meeting like TAG team or SAA or Evaluators or External Toastmasters.\nAvoid calling prepared speakers or TOD or GE as they get the most stage time in the meeting.",

Call others who didn't get a chance to speak.\nThe first person you call should be someone pretty confident. The reason is it motivates others, especially the guest to seem like it’s easy.",
