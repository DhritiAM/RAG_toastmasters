You are free to get as creative as you can in terms of explaining the theme, introducing people, etc.\nAlways remember, as a host, your duty is not to be the star of the meeting, it is to make every person who comes to speak feel like a superstar. You are their cheerleader for the meeting.\n\nBefore the meeting:\nThink of an interesting theme that is most relevant to your audience and the situation. \nFor example: if you are a TOD when Independence day is around the corner then have a theme that relates more to it. But don’t make it cliche. Give it your own unique touch. “The fight for Freedom” “Freedom is a state of mind” “Freedom Quest” “The unsung heroes”\n\nGet in touch with the VPE to know about the role takers and speakers for the meeting way prior.",
