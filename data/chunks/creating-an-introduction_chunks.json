This product consists of four parts: Definition and explanation of the presentation Guidelines for your introduction to the audience Outline for the development of your speech PowerPoint presentation In Your Own Words The outline is not a script and should not be read word-for-word. Instead, use the document as a guide for presenting the material in your own words and with your own narrative style. The outline is a structure on which to build your presentation. Use the points of the outline to develop your speech, but be the author of your own oration. Here are some tips on using this outline to develop and deliver your presentation: Study the outline carefully. Familiarize yourself with the general structure.

Highlight key words or sentences to help you present the material most effectively. Be expressive when delivering your speech. Use all of the presentation skills you have learned as a Toastmaster including vocal variety and gestures. USING VISUAL AIDS EFFECTIVELY Visual aids add interest to any presentation and help your audience retain information. If you plan to use the PowerPoint slides for this presentation as visual aids, make sure you have the equipment and technology needed to share the slides with your audience. It is recommended that you test your technology and equipment in advance.

If your presentation is taking place in a fully in-person format but you do not have the equipment needed to share the PowerPoint, you could create a flip chart using the visuals from the slides. Follow these tips when using visual aids in an in-person setting: Set them up and test them before the meeting begins. Place them so they are easily visible to listeners. Bring backup equipment in case your technology fails. Display your visuals only when they are needed. If you are using a flip chart, flip the page back out of view when you are finished with it. Remember not to stand between the screen or flip chart and your audience or you will block their view. Maintain eye contact with your listeners",

If you must turn your back to point out something, pause as you point it out, and then resume speaking only after you are once again facing your audience. Follow these tips when using visuals in the online or hybrid setting: Share your screen. Be sure your PowerPoint presentation is visible in the room and on the screens of those members participating from another location. Consider having someone else share the visuals so you can maintain eye contact with the camera. Consider an online whiteboard when sharing information, as it will be visible to both mem- bers in the room and those participating online. Consider enlisting the assistance of a partner to join the meeting on their computer in the room with you so that they can facilitate the remote attendees and monitor what is happening online. This is a good practice for all hybrid meetings. Test your online platform and technology before the meeting begins",

Share any handouts or other documents you use as part of your presentation with all attendees in advance or via the chat function of your meeting app so that all participants have access to them at the same time.

THE BETTER SPEAKER SERIES 4 CREATING AN INTRODUCTION 5 CREATING AN INTRODUCTION Outline INTRODUCTION Not everyone is comfortable with the concept of a speech introduction. An inaccurate or unex- pected introduction can fluster even the most prepared speaker. While speech introductions can be challenging to organize and present, they are also a very necessary part of our Toastmasters meetings. THE IMPORTANCE OF AN INTRODUCTION A well-crafted introduction enhances a presentation by providing the following: Smooth transition When members of your club or audience get up to speak, they are about to take on a new role. An introduction defines that role and prepares the audience for a shift from previous activities by refocusing their interest",

    "text": ". Proper mindset Audience members are more likely to appreciate a speech if they are given some background information about the speaker and the topic to be discussed. A skillful introduction can do this as well as set a desired mood or tone. Speaker authority A good introduction helps establish the speakers expertise or back- ground in the subject. If the topic is education, for example, the introduction should inform us if the speaker has three school-aged children or is a member of the local school board. GENERAL ESSENTIALS Since a speech introduction must be brief, it should be exceptionally well planned. If you have been assigned to present an introduction, your primary consideration is to inform the audience of three essential points: Speakers name Always say the speakers name distinctly and clearly, especially at the very end of the introduction. If the name has a tricky pronunciation, confirm the correct way, and then write it out phonetically for yourself",

    "text": ". Speech topic Relate the speakers background and credentials to the speech topic. Then tell how the topic will benefit the audience. Ask yourself why this subject is appropriate for this particular audience. Speech title The speechs title is typically mentioned at the end of the introduction. Like the speakers name, it needs to be given special emphasis. TOASTMASTERS ESSENTIALS If you are introducing a fellow Toastmaster at a club meeting, your introduction should also include three crucial elements: Speech assignment Tell the audience which project the speaker is completing in the Pathways learning experience. V1 V2 V3 6 THE BETTER SPEAKER SERIES 4 CREATING AN INTRODUCTION V4 V5 V6 Speech objectives State the assignments main objectives and the personal objectives of the speaker.

DRAFTING THE INTRODUCTION Aside from relating practical information, introductions create a friendly environment for the speaker and a sense of anticipation for the audience. As you draft an introduction, imagine yourself in the position of the speaker. Approach As speaker, what manner would make you feel appreciated and welcome? Length Generally, a 30- to 45-second introduction is about right for most Toastmasters manual speeches. Longer speeches may accommodate introductions lasting up to two minutes. Remember, your audience members are waiting to hear the speaker. Delivery Rehearse. A polished delivery will engage the audiences interest and curiosity. Clarification Always ask the speaker what should be included in the introduction, and make an effort to use words and ideas suggested by the speaker",

    "text": ". APPLYING RESTRAINT The primary purpose of a speechs introduction is to lead the listener into the speakers presenta- tion. Unless you seek a reputation for verbosity, this is not the time to embellish or prolong the suspense of the audience. When planning an introduction, heed the following donts: Dont upstage the speaker. Your task is to turn attention to the speaker not to yourself. This means eliminating any anecdotes about your experiences, attitudes, and opinions. Dont reveal any details of the speech. An introduction should invite anticipation of the upcoming speech. The contents of a speech should never be previewed in an introduction. Dont surprise the speaker. Never include information that might embarrass or in some way distract from the speakers message. As the introducer, you are there to support the speaker and make that persons transition to the lectern as smooth as possible. Dont praise the speakers skills. Generous compliments can encourage unreasonable expectations",

    "text": ". Dont praise the speakers skills. Generous compliments can encourage unreasonable expectations. Let the audience decide the skill of the speaker. Dont rely on clichs. Your time is much too valuable to clutter it with trite phrases, such as, This speaker needs no introduction. Other worn-out expressions to avoid include, We have with us tonight..., Without further ado..., and It gives me great pleasure to present... Dont save the speakers name until last. Unless you are introducing a mystery guest, dont create false anticipation. Since audiences are usually aware of who will be speaking, incorpo- rating the persons name once or twice before pronouncing it a final time is a far more natural approach. SPEAKERS RESPONSIBILITIES Far from being a solo assignment, the creation of a good introduction is actually a two-way effort between the speaker and the person introducing the speaker",

For the benefit of the overall presen- tation, the speaker has the following responsibilities: THE BETTER SPEAKER SERIES 4 CREATING AN INTRODUCTION 7 Be available to offer speech-related information. An introducer may have pertinent ques- tions for the speaker. Beginning speakers are often apprehensive about contributing to their own introductions for fear of being considered conceited for speaking highly of themselves. It is important that the speaker is available to answer relevant questions. Inform the introducer of any special considerations. For example, if a question-and- answer period is to be included at the end of the speech, this information needs to be incor- porated into the introduction. LECTERN ETIQUETTE Writing a good introduction is only half of the job. The other half includes a relaxed, professional delivery that creates a friendly atmosphere between both speaker and audience",

    "text": ". To create a pleasant ambiance, the proper etiquette should be followed: Speak to the audience. Primary eye contact should be with the audience members until the speakers name is mentioned for the final time. Lead the applause. When the speakers name is stated for the last time, begin applauding. The audience members take their cues from those who have demonstrated authority at the lectern. Shake hands. Once the speaker has reached the lectern, the introducer shakes the speakers hand. Leave the lectern. The introducer does not cross in front of or behind the speaker. Instead, return to your seat by moving in a direction away from the speaker. Show interest. Continue to show interest and involvement throughout the speech presenta- tion, especially if you remain in view of the audience. INTRODUCTIONS ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING When the speech has concluded and the introducer is back at the lectern, the introducer may add about 30 seconds worth of summary comments",
