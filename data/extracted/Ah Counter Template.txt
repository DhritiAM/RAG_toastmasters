Ah Counter Template

This template will help you understand the role of an Ah counter. You are also free to get as creative as you can in terms of the role and presenting the reports based on the theme of the meeting.

As the 'ah counter' 
You need to count the crutch words of everyone including SAA, President, GE, Speakers, Evaluators, table topic speakers, and role takers. The role requires you to be a keen listener throughout the meeting.

C - Crutch words (and, so, but)
R - Repeats (I..I, this means, this means)
P - Pauses (Unnecessary long pause)
F - Filler sounds (ah, Um, er)

Guidelines to be read when asked to introduce your role during the meeting:

Thank you, Mister/Madam Toastmaster, Fellow Toastmasters, and welcome Guests! My duty as the “Ah” Counter is to listen carefully for verbal distractions, such as “um,” “ah”, “you know,” “and-so,” “but,” and other filler words or sounds. I will also keep track of the repeated words, like “the, the,” and, “I, I.” Lastly, I keep track of long pauses. I will keep track of the number of these speaking errors in writing for each person that speaks and give a report when called upon at the end of the meeting. 

When the GE calls you to give out the Ah counter report:

When you give your report in the end in the interest of time, just share total crutch words used by a person and mention their most used words. However if there is time then ideally read out the entire report. Do give a suggestion or two to avoid crutch words.


Note: Time limit is 1 minute to read out ah counter role initially (that is to read the above paragraph) and in the end, 2 mins to give your ah counter report
